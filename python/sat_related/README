activities_scaled.py

  Usage: python activities_scaled.py <dimacs_file_name> <random_seed> <out_file_name> 

  Description: run minisat on the dimacs file that represents a sat instance with random
   seed as a parameter for minisat, append the following line to the out_file:
       scaled final activity score of each variable + runtime of minisat + # of conflicts
  Note 1: the activity score is used by the VSIDS heuristics to pick the next braching variable.  
  Note 2: scaling is done by make the largest raw activity score 100, and scale down the other
   activity scores proportionally.


activities_unscaled.py

  Same as activities_scaled.py execpt the raw activity scores are recorded.


activities_over_time.py

  Usage: python activities_over_time.py <dimacs_file_name> <random_seed> <out_file_name> 

  Description: run minisat on the dimacs file that represents a sat instance with random
   seed as a parameter for minisat, record the activity score of each variable whenever
   DPLL algorithm pick a new branching variable. The data is saved to out_file as a comma separated
   text file, each line contains
   	variable name +  activity scores of a variable


analyze_formula.py

  Usage: python analyze_formula.py <dimacs_file_name>
  
  Description: takes in a (3)sat formula, print out the
    1. VIG degree
    2. VCG degrees
    3. ratio of positive literal occurrence to negative literal occurrence
    4. occurrence
  of each variable.


backbones.py

  Usage: python backbones.py <dimacs_file_name>
  
  Description: takes in a (3)sat formula, print out the backbone variables of the formula
   (variables that has the same value in each solution).


minisat_var_rank.py

  Usage: python minisat_var_rank.py <dimacs_file_name> <out_file_name>

  Description: Run modified minisat that picks the available variable with the highest VIG
   degree as the branching heuristics. Append the result to the out_file as a line like:
   	  <dimacs_file_name>, Conflict, CPU time


random_ksat.py

  Usage: python random_ksat.py <numvars> <numclauses> <outputfile>

  Description: generate random 3sat instance
